<p id="des"> 
Hi, I’m Leslie Soto, a web developer passionate about creating clean, functional websites.
 I’ve been building my skills in HTML and CSS over the past year, and I’m currently diving into JavaScript.
I’m constantly learning and growing in the field, taking on new challenges and projects to strengthen 
my abilities.

<p id="des">Right now, I’m focused on creating landing pages that help businesses communicate their message 
effectively and engage their audience. I’m particularly passionate about building simple, high-converting 
landing pages that drive results for businesses.</p>
